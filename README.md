Intention
=======

This intention of this project is to act as a playground for Chimp candidates to submit their coding samples and projects to. If you have any questions about anything please fire them towards [chris@chimp.net](mailto:chris@chimp.net). 

Requirements - Details
=======

Please create a website. This website can be contructed in the language of your choosing. 

Please import the file "data.csv" (located in the root of this project) into a database. This dataset will be used as the source sample data for the project. Each line-item in the csv represents a single *Group* object.

When visiting the root path of the website you should display a page that allows you to select a *Group*. Once a *Group* has been selected, the page should additionall display valid block of HTML code that can be copied and pasted onto any other web site.

When you copy and paste this HTML code into another site, and subsequently load that site in your browser, that site should display the *Group Name* along with the *Group Balance* (from the *name* and *balance* fields in the CSV) at the location on the page where you pasted your generated HTML snippet. These two values (*Group Name* and *Group Balance*) should be retrieved dynamically.

Please fill in the placeholder sections below once completed with all necessary information.
