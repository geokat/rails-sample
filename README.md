Intention
=======

This intention of this project is to act as a playground for Chimp candidates to submit their coding samples and projects to. If you have any questions about anything please fire them towards [chris@chimp.net](mailto:chris@chimp.net). 

Requirements - Details
=======

Please create a website. This website can be contructed in the language of your choosing. 

Please import the file "data.csv" (located in the root of this project) into a database. This dataset will be used as the source sample data for the project. Each line-item in the csv represents a single *Group* object.

When you visit the root path of the website you should be given a page that allows you to select a *Group*. Once you locate a *Group* the page should display a block of HTML valid code that can be cut and paste into any other site.

When you cut and paste this HTML code into other site (and load the other site) it should display the *Group Name* along with the *Group Balance* (from the *name* and *balance* fields in the CSV) on the site the code was embedded on for the *Group* you originally selected. These two values (*Group Name* and *Group Balance*) should be retrieved dynamically.

Please fill in the placeholder sections below once completed with all necessary information.
